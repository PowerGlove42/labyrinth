🌀 Labyrinth of Smoke

A surreal puzzle game where survival means lighting up.
🔥 Overview

Labyrinth of Smoke is a dark and twisted puzzle-adventure game where your mind is your worst enemy—and your only escape is through smoke. Navigate a shifting maze filled with deadly traps, bizarre logic puzzles, and a growing dependence on your next hit.

Your goal: find the Golden Hookah and escape the labyrinth.

But there's a catch:

    If you don't smoke, you die.
    But every puff brings you closer to your next craving... faster than before.

🧩 Gameplay

    Stay alive by smoking. But beware—the interval between necessary smokes shortens each time. Balance puzzle-solving with your growing addiction.

    🌀 Mind-Bending Puzzles
    Solve a variety of puzzles and deal with unpredictable logic. Each room offers a new kind of confusion.

    🏆 Find the Golden Hookah
    Your ultimate objective is hidden deep within the labyrinth.
